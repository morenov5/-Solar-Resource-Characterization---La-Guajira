# -Solar-Resource-Characterization---La-Guajira
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning-based framework for solar resource characterization using NASA POWER data. The project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for forecasting solar irradiance (GHI) and compares its performance with traditional models, including Linear Regression and a Naive baseline.
